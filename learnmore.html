    <p>I'm Akshit Bhatt, but you can call me sir.</p>
    <p>Originally hailing from Uttrakhand,India for last 1 year or so I've been honing my skills in design,production and management roles building products for the web,mobile,games and more recently,VR & AR.</p>
    <p> I strive to create elegant solutions that surprise and delight users, while keeping complex technical dependences in mind for implementation, scalability and developer sanity.</p>
    <p>I've worked with small ,agileteams on skunworks projects and larger development teams with prduct lifecycles spanning multiple years.</p>
    <p>Depending on the team, resources and ddeliverables i've worn many hats overs years-holding titles like Product Designer,Front-End Developer.</p>
    <p>I also occasionally give talks on design and product development.</p>
